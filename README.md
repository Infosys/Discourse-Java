This application was generated using JHipster 6.10.5, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.10.5](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.10.5).

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
npm install
```

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

```

./mvnw


npm start
```

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

## OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect

Congratulations! You've selected an excellent way to secure your JHipster application. If you're not sure what OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are, please see [What the Heck is OAuth?](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth)

To log in to your app, you'll need to have [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) up and running. The JHipster Team has created a Docker container for you that has the default users and roles. Start Keycloak using the following command.

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up
```

The security settings in `src/main/resources/config/application.yml` are configured for this image.

```yaml
spring:
  ...
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: web_app
            client-secret: web_app
```

### Okta

If you'd like to use Okta instead of Keycloak, you'll need to change a few things. First, you'll need to create a free developer account at <https://developer.okta.com/signup/>. After doing so, you'll get your own Okta domain, that has a name like `https://dev-123456.okta.com`.

Modify `src/main/resources/config/application.yml` to use your Okta settings.

```yaml
spring:
  ...
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: {clientId}
            client-secret: {clientSecret}
security:
```

Create an OIDC App in Okta to get a `{clientId}` and `{clientSecret}`. To do this, log in to your Okta Developer account and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Web** and click the **Next** button. Give the app a name youâ€™ll remember, specify `http://localhost:8080` as a Base URI, and `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc` as a Login Redirect URI. Click **Done**, then Edit and add `http://localhost:8080` as a Logout redirect URI. Copy and paste the client ID and secret into your `application.yml` file.

Create a `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER` group and add users into them. Modify e2e tests to use this account when running integration tests. You'll need to change credentials in `src/test/javascript/e2e/account/account.spec.ts` and `src/test/javascript/e2e/admin/administration.spec.ts`.

Navigate to **API** > **Authorization Servers**, click the **Authorization Servers** tab and edit the default one. Click the **Claims** tab and **Add Claim**. Name it "groups", and include it in the ID Token. Set the value type to "Groups" and set the filter to be a Regex of `.*`.

After making these changes, you should be good to go! If you have any issues, please post them to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jhipster). Make sure to tag your question with "jhipster" and "okta".

### PWA Support

JHipster ships with PWA (Progressive Web App) support, and it's turned off by default. One of the main components of a PWA is a service worker.

The service worker initialization code is commented out by default. To enable it, uncomment the following code in `src/main/webapp/index.html`:

```html
<script>
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('./service-worker.js').then(function () {
      console.log('Service Worker Registered');
    });
  }
</script>
```

Note: [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) powers JHipster's service worker. It dynamically generates the `service-worker.js` file.

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

```
npm install --save --save-exact leaflet
```

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @types/leaflet
```

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
Edit [src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts](src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts) file:

```
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
```

Edit [src/main/webapp/content/scss/vendor.scss](src/main/webapp/content/scss/vendor.scss) file:

```
@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
```

Note: There are still a few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

### Using Angular CLI

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

```
ng generate component my-component
```

will generate few files:

```
create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
update src/main/webapp/app/app.module.ts
```

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the discourse application for production, run:

```

./mvnw -Pprod clean verify


```

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

```

java -jar target/*.jar


```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```

./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify


```

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw verify
```

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

```
npm test
```

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
./mvnw -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
```

Then run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
